## Hi there,   I am Prachi Jaiswal👋 (She/ Her)

I am currently in the final semester of my Master’s degree in Business Analytics at Monash University. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Symbiosis Institute of Technology. I recently worked as a research scholar at the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood to examine Arbovirus transmission in Australia. I'm well-versed in the R programming language (RShiny, Xaringan, Distill Blog), MySQL, Figma and HTML5/CSS3.

I am passionate about data visualisation and analysis. To enhance my capacity to communicate and provide users with insightful information about data, I'm pursuing user behaviour and experience design.

I do a lot of things outside of my field of study. In high school, I was heavily involved in organizational tasks related to clubs, tournaments, and workshops, which aided me with the development of skills like communication, leadership, and time management.
